## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Read the data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
# Read in data
# positional data about the RV Kahuna
# kahuna <- read_csv('../../../presentations/2018/2018-12-03_DUML-RepResearch/data/2018-11-26_2017-Cape-Hatteras-BRS-kahuna-CEE.csv') 
kahuna <- read_csv('2018-11-26_2017-Cape-Hatteras-BRS-kahuna-CEE.csv')
kStart <- kahuna %>% 
  filter(status == 'start')

# Read in Gm182 Data: 100 estimated positions of Gm182, augmented with focal follow data
gm182UP <- read_csv('2018-11-27_Gm182-UserPoints-Start-CEE-Locations-Kahuna.csv') %>% 
  mutate(status = 'userPoints')

# Read in Gm182 Data: 100 estimated positions of Gm182
gm182 <- read_csv('2018-11-27_Gm182-Start-CEE-Locations-Kahuna.csv') %>% 
  mutate(status = 'noUserPoints')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
